# Graph algorithms course at AGH UST
The repository with solutions from Graph algorithms (Algorytmy grafowe) lab classes at the AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me and codes written during lab classes. All codes are written in English. The leading programming language during this course was Python.
## Table of contents
Table of contents consists of specific sections in repository. There are 4 directories with solved tasks from lab classes. Project_1 is a mandatory project made to finish the laboratories. It was made for the maximum number of points (100 %). There is also a directory *Additional_functions* and inside it there is a file with functions that load graphs.
